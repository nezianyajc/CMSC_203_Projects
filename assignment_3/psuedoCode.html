  <h4>StringInBounds(); Method</h4>
  <p></p>
  <br>
    Method should receive a string </br>
    Method should loop through string </br>
    Method should convert string to character and pass the index from the loop as an argument to the char at method </br>
    if the character greater than and equal to the Lower bound and Less or equal to the Upper bound </br>
            the methods boolean is set to true </br>
    else the boolean is set to false
    Method returns the boolean
  </p>
  Method should receive a string Method should loop through string Method should
  check each character of string and determine if it's inbounds

  <h4>encryptCaesar(); Method</h4>
  <br>
      Declare an empty string for the value that will be encrypted </br>
      Use the StringInBounds method to test the input </br>
      Store plaintext into variable </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the plaintext variable </br>
      Convert string to character by passing the index to the charAt method during each iteration. </br>
      Convert character into an integer and add the key argument. </br>
      Store new value into a variable. </br>
      While the stored value is greater than the Upper Bound subtract the range from the stored value.</br>
      After the loop has completed store the difference in the empty string variable</br>
      Return new string.
    </p>

    <h4>decryptCaesar(); Method</h4>
    <p>
      Declare an empty string for the value that will be decrypted </br>
      Store encryptedtext into variable </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the encryptedtext variable </br>
      Convert string to character by passing the index to the charAt method during each iteration. </br>
      Convert character into an integer and subtract the key argument. </br>
      Store new value into a variable. </br>
      While the stored value is less than the Lower Bound add the range to the stored value.</br>
      After the loop has completed store the sum in the empty string variable</br>
      Return new string.

    </p>
    <h4>encryptBellaso(); Method</h4>
    <br>
      Declare an empty string for the value that will be encrypted </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the plaintext variable </br>
      Get character value of the index of the string and store it in a variable. </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the bellaso string </br>
      Get character value of the index of the string and store its remainder in a variable. </br>
      Add the plaintext and bellaso character values and store them in a variable
      While the sum value from the previous step is greater than the upper bound subtract the range.
      Store the new difference in the empty string 
      Return the new string.
    </p>

    <h4>decryptBellaso(); Method</h4>
    <br>
      Declare an empty string for the value that will be decrypted </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the encryptedtext variable </br>
      Get character value of the index of the string and store it in a variable. </br>
      Use a for loop to iterate through the length of the bellaso string </br>
      Get character value of the index of the string and store its remainder in a variable. </br>
      Subtract the bellaso character from the plaintext character values and store them in a variable
      While the difference value from the previous step is lower than the lower bound add the range.
      Store the new sum in the empty string 
      Return the new string.
